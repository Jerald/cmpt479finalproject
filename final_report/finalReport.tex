\section{Introduction}

%- What we're doing
%- How we're doing it
%- What we've done

Game development is one of the fastest growing software development fields. In the modern age where the industry is quickly embracing automated testing to help catch errors, game development hasn't kept up. In an attempt to remedy this, we introduce BAD: a three-phase system to automatically verify and generate program assertions to help validate correct game behaviour.

BAD is based around creating a tick-agnostic model of game object interactions to attempt to summarize relevant game object behaviour. Our system does this over three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{Model Generation:}} by analyzing the code of a game we abstract away game objects to simply their name, modifiable fields, and the ways they interact with other objects. 
    \item {\textbf{Assertion Verification:}} using the model generated in phase 1 along with assertions provided to the system, we apply a type of inductive proof to see if the assertions are upheld, or how they could be invalidated.
    \item{\textbf{Assertion Generation:}} by taking in information about the layout of a game (say, level information) and combining it with the generated model, the system will look for types of idiomatic mistakes and symptomatic designs which should be checked for correctness.
\end{enumerate}

We've created a proof-of-concept implementation of BAD in C\#, targeting the Unity game engine. We use .NET Core as the runtime for the system, so it can be used cross-platform. Currently the system performs effective generation of the model and basic analysis of assertions. The assertion generation phase of the system is still being designed, but we have a solid design plan laid out for when the time comes.

\section{Background}

The game development industry has yet to fully embrace automated testing and to this day, game testing remains a very hands-on labour intensive process. Manual testing of video games is slow, expensive, and results in poor coverage of the total game state space. As an extreme, yet real world, example, there is still a job in which someone is paid to spend hundreds of hours bumping into walls to test collision. The current state of video game testing is ripe for improvements. Automation would bring much needed efficiency to the industry.

%TODO
A noteworthy example of automated game testing is the \textit{Walk Monster}~\cite{WalkMonster} exploration tool which was written for \textit{The Witness}. 

\section{Approach}

BAD has the three phases of \textbf{Model Generation}, \textbf{Assertion Validation}, and \textbf{Assertion Generation}. Together these form of the core of the how the BAD system accomplishes its goal. 

\subsection{Phase One: Model Generation}

Our model is a \textbf{tick-agnostic} abstraction of game object interaction representing overall game behaviour. \textbf{Tick-agnostic} is referring to how we model the state of game objects at an arbitrary point in time. By typical design, games have at their core a main loop running every frame (or \textbf{tick}) where game object code is ran. Standard program analysis tools tend to look at the paths a program can take, a process not well suited to dealing with the heavily loop-based design of games. Our model creates a generic snapshot of how game objects can interact at any point, letting us avoid the key issue.

The model is represented by a dirgraph where nodes represent game objects and edges represent their interaction, annotated with what the interaction is. Stored within a node we have an ID (often simply the class name) as well as references to the incoming and outgoing edges. The specific way we represent interactions between nodes is by the operations one node may apply to another. These edges provide an encoding of how, what, and by who parts of a given game object can ever be affected. 

At a high level, you can think of the graph as representing the state of the game at some arbitrary tick $k$, as opposed to any concrete point in the execution. The nodes can then be thought of as functions, taking all the fields modified by their edges as input, and producing the state at tick $k + 1$ as an output. So by using this, we can apply some, or all, of the possible modifications to a node and then examine generically what would happen as a result. This is the key distinction of our model versus other typical analysis systems.

To create the actual model itself in our reference implementation, we take in game source code compiled to a CIL\endnote{CIL is the Common Intermedeary Language. It's the low-level pseudo-assembly language ran on the .NET platform.} binary, known as an assembly. We utilize the \textit{Mono.Cecil}~\cite{Mono.Cecil} library to load and read the raw CIL. From there we identify game objects (in this case classes) to create nodes of, then search for and identify idioms within the code which correspond to affecting another game object. The actual operations applied by the effect are then encoded onto the edge between the nodes and its annotation. 

\subsection{Phase Two: Assertion Verification}

Our assertion verification system is moddeled as an inductive proof,


It can get tricky typesetting Tcl and C code in LaTeX because they share
a lot of mystical feelings about certain magic characters.  You
will have to do a lot of escaping to typeset curly braces and percent
signs, for example, like this:
``The {\tt \%module} directive
sets the name of the initialization function.  This is optional, but is
recommended if building a Tcl 7.5 module.
Everything inside the {\tt \%\{, \%\}}
block is copied directly into the output. allowing the inclusion of
header files and additional C code." \\

Sometimes you want to really call attention to a piece of text.  You
can center it in the column like this:
\begin{center}
{\tt \_1008e614\_Vector\_p}
\end{center}
and people will really notice it.\\

\noindent
The noindent at the start of this paragraph makes it clear that it's
a continuation of the preceding text, not a new para in its own right.


Now this is an ingenious way to get a forced space.
{\tt Real~$*$} and {\tt double~$*$} are equivalent. 

Now here is another way to call attention to a line of code, but instead
of centering it, we noindent and bold it.\\

\noindent
{\bf \tt size\_t : fread ptr size nobj stream } \\

And here we have made an indented para like a definition tag (dt)
in HTML.  You don't need a surrounding list macro pair.
\begin{itemize}
\item[]  {\tt fread} reads from {\tt stream} into the array {\tt ptr} at
most {\tt nobj} objects of size {\tt size}.   {\tt fread} returns
the number of objects read. 
\end{itemize}
This concludes the definitions tag.

\subsection{Phase Three: Assertion Generation}

This is the stage of BAD where we've not implemented any functionality yet. Though despite that, we've designed an outline for how we'll approach the problem in the future. Our end goal would to be able to generate a suite of effective assertions that model the intended behaviour of the objects within the game.

Generation of assertions is the last step for a complete implementation of BAD. Rather than a user needing to provide the assertions for phase two to verify, this phase tried to analyze the provided code to determine things that should be asserted. Some possible assertions can be generated strictly from analyzing the code representing the game object behaviour, but some assertions need greater information. To solve this problem we propose taking additional information about the game world, usually in the form of the object hierarchy and arrangement in the world. Using this information, we're able to seed the model with concrete values instead of it being purely abstract, which can then be used to augment the search for more novel and useful assertions.

Some possible types of assertions we've thought could be good are ones related to collision verification, violating impassable terrain, ensuring correct outcome of object interaction, and other interaction-related correctness issues. Most of these are fundamentally not difficult to specifically find useful information about, but would each require specialized techniques to be developed for. This would make it hard to generalize the technique across assertions to generate, but we're still investigating other possible new approaches to find more general assertions.

\section{Future Work}

The most pressing piece of future work for BAD is to actually implement a functional version of the third phase: Assertion Generation. This would turn BAD into a complete and actually practically useful piece of software for testing games. Beyond that, there are a number of ideas we have for applying some or all of the components of BAD. Though the ones we think are most interesting are other applications of the model we've designed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Performance modeling:}} since the model encodes the way in which any sets of game objects could every interact, the information could be applied to identify independent computations which could then be parallellized. This has the possibility of dramatically improving the performance of a game that was previously running exclusively in one thread.  
    \item {\textbf{Providing a viewable version of the model:}} simply providing a way for a developer to render and view the generated model could be useful for development. By representing actions between objects in a more visual and informative way, poor design could be identified and fixed earlier and more effectively than otherwise.
    \item{\textbf{Optimization and code design suggestions:}} by knowing exactly how code interacts, the model can show otherwise invisible situations where code is called too often, or where it could benefit from a common abstraction. We'd propose a very similar fundamental design as assertion generation, but focusing on developer feedback instead of game restrictions.
\end{itemize}

Aside from that, a obvious path for future work is to port the system to other game engines and development environments. This would allow the system to be used by a broader audience and to possibly inspire more automated testing tools for game development.

\section{Conclusion}

We've shown BAD, our system to attempt to fill the automated testing gap that exists in the game development industry. BAD provides a three-phase system of generating a model, verifying assertions, then generating assertions automatically. We introduced a novel, or at least we think it is, model for representing tick-agnostic systems such as games.

Most of our work went into designing the backbone architecture for the system as well as designing the specifics of the model. We're hoping that this work helps make it significantly easier to develop and extend the system in the future. After that, the rest of our work went into designing the way in which we'd validate the provided assertions in phase two.
