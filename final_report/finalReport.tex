Game development is one of the fastest growing software development fields. In the modern age where the industry is quickly embracing automated testing to help catch errors, game development hasn't kept up. In an attempt to remedy this, we introduce BAD: a three-phase system to automatically verify and generate program assertions to help validate correct game behaviour. 
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

BAD is based around creating a tick-agnostic model of game object interactions to attempt to summarize relevant game object behaviour. Our system does this over three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{Model Generation:}} by analyzing the code of a game we abstract away game objects to simply their name, modifiable fields, and the ways they interact with other objects. 
    \item {\textbf{Assertion Verification:}} using the model generated in phase 1 along with assertions provided to the system, we apply a type of inductive proof to see if the assertions are upheld, or how they could be invalidated.
    \item{\textbf{Assertion Generation:}} by taking in information about the layout of a game (say, level information) and combining it with the generated model, the system will look for types of idiomatic mistakes and symptomatic designs which should be checked for correctness.
\end{enumerate}

We've created a proof-of-concept implementation of BAD in C\#, targeting the Unity game engine. We use .NET Core as the runtime for the system, so it can be used cross-platform. Currently the system performs effective generation of the model and basic analysis of assertions. The assertion generation phase of the system is still being designed, but we have a solid design plan laid out for when the time comes.

\section{Background}

The game development industry has yet to fully embrace automated testing and to this day, game testing remains a very hands-on labour intensive process. Manual testing of video games is slow, expensive, and results in poor coverage of the total game state space. As an extreme, yet real world, example, there is still a job in which someone is paid to spend hundreds of hours bumping into walls to test collisions. The current state of the video game testing

Some embedded literal typset code might 
look like the following :

{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
int wrap_fact(ClientData clientData,
              Tcl_Interp *interp,
              int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int result;
    int arg0;
    if (argc != 2) {
        interp->result = "wrong # args";
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
    arg0 = atoi(argv[1]);
    result = fact(arg0);
    sprintf(interp->result,"%d",result);
    return TCL_OK;
}
\end{verbatim}
}

Now we're going to cite somebody.  Watch for the cite tag.
Here it comes~\cite{Chaum1981,Diffie1976}.  The tilde character (\~{})
in the source means a non-breaking space.  This way, your reference will
always be attached to the word that preceded it, instead of going to the
next line.

\section{Approach}

BAD has the three phases of \textbf{Model Generation}, \textbf{Assertion Validation}, and \textbf{Assertion Generation}. Together these form of the core of the how the BAD system accomplishes its goal. 

\subsection{Phase One: Model Generation}

Our model is a \textbf{tick-agnostic} abstraction of game object \textbf{interaction} representing overall game behaviour. \textbf{Tick-agnostic} is referring to how we model the state of game objects at an arbitrary point in time. By typical design, games have at their core a main loop, 

Here's a typical figure reference.  The figure is centered at the
top of the column.  It's scaled.  It's explicitly placed.  You'll
have to tweak the numbers to get what you want.\\

% you can also use the wonderful epsfig package...
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\begin{picture}(300,150)(0,200)
\put(-15,-30){\special{psfile = fig1.ps hscale = 50 vscale = 50}}
\end{picture}\\
\end{center}
\caption{Wonderful Flowchart}
\end{figure}

This text came after the figure, so we'll casually refer to Figure 1
as we go on our merry way.

\subsection{Phase Two: Assertion Verification}

It can get tricky typesetting Tcl and C code in LaTeX because they share
a lot of mystical feelings about certain magic characters.  You
will have to do a lot of escaping to typeset curly braces and percent
signs, for example, like this:
``The {\tt \%module} directive
sets the name of the initialization function.  This is optional, but is
recommended if building a Tcl 7.5 module.
Everything inside the {\tt \%\{, \%\}}
block is copied directly into the output. allowing the inclusion of
header files and additional C code." \\

Sometimes you want to really call attention to a piece of text.  You
can center it in the column like this:
\begin{center}
{\tt \_1008e614\_Vector\_p}
\end{center}
and people will really notice it.\\

\noindent
The noindent at the start of this paragraph makes it clear that it's
a continuation of the preceding text, not a new para in its own right.


Now this is an ingenious way to get a forced space.
{\tt Real~$*$} and {\tt double~$*$} are equivalent. 

Now here is another way to call attention to a line of code, but instead
of centering it, we noindent and bold it.\\

\noindent
{\bf \tt size\_t : fread ptr size nobj stream } \\

And here we have made an indented para like a definition tag (dt)
in HTML.  You don't need a surrounding list macro pair.
\begin{itemize}
\item[]  {\tt fread} reads from {\tt stream} into the array {\tt ptr} at
most {\tt nobj} objects of size {\tt size}.   {\tt fread} returns
the number of objects read. 
\end{itemize}
This concludes the definitions tag.

\subsection{Phase Three: Assertion Generation}

You have to run {\tt latex} once to prepare your references for
munging.  Then run {\tt bibtex} to build your bibliography metadata.
Then run {\tt latex} twice to ensure all references have been resolved.
If your source file is called {\tt usenixTemplate.tex} and your {\tt
  bibtex} file is called {\tt usenixTemplate.bib}, here's what you do:
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
latex usenixTemplate
bibtex usenixTemplate
latex usenixTemplate
latex usenixTemplate
\end{verbatim}
}


\subsection{Last SubSection}

Well, it's getting boring isn't it.  This is the last subsection
before we wrap it up.

\section{Evaluation \& Observations}

\section{Related Work}

\section{Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}

A polite author always includes acknowledgments.  Thank everyone,
especially those who funded the work. 

\section{Availability}

It's great when this section says that MyWonderfulApp is free software, 
available via anonymous FTP from

\begin{center}
{\tt ftp.site.dom/pub/myname/Wonderful}\\
\end{center}

Also, it's even greater when you can write that information is also 
available on the Wonderful homepage at 

\begin{center}
{\tt http://www.site.dom/\~{}myname/SWIG}
\end{center}

Now we get serious and fill in those references.  Remember you will
have to run latex twice on the document in order to resolve those
cite tags you met earlier.  This is where they get resolved.
We've preserved some real ones in addition to the template-speak.
After the bibliography you are DONE.
